## üáÆüá± Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Israel: Per my observation, In Israel, QA was taken to the limits higher than the 80/20 concept and everything was tested thoroughly and needed to run bear fruit and return results in a very short amount of time.
(5000 complex tests running across 300 browsers concurrently with pass rates of 99%+ and minimal flakiness)
- Japan: Japan's testing characteristics follow their culture. 
    * In Japan, there is a big focus on the quality of code being written and this can be a huge bottleneck sometimes, given that testing is usually not customer facing, the focus on perfecting the code before submission can be a pain.
    * Difficulty in making changes in a big organization! I came from startups in Israel and things moved very quickly, I'm not sure if this is Japan specific or large organization based, but making changes and imposing new tech stacks is difficult.
    * When I first joined, I was surprised to see that the ratio of manual testers to Automation engineers was like 4 to 1, but then later all manual testers got converted to Automation engineers, similarly to what I had in Israel.
    * Risk aversion ‚Äì a preference for proven methods rather than experimentation with new tools or practices.
    * Slow adoption of automation and agile ‚Äì change takes time due to strong reliance on established processes.
    * Events are taken seriously and addressed right away, but I would say it was a bit more demanding in Israel to find data and root cause analysis to make sure it doesn't happen again and write dedicated automated test cases to cover that edge case.
    * Communication might is a bit vague since asians prefer to not be too direct, so coming up with solutions or agreeing on architecture can take some more time.
