## üáØüáµ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Turkey: Per my observation, In Turkey, dedicated QA teams were more dominant compared to integrated QA teams. 
- Japan: Japan's testing characteristics follow their culture. 
    * Process-oriented and disciplined: doing things the right way, not just doing them fast.
    * Act as a team and Emphasis on group harmony, no strong individualism
    * Respect for hierarchy, managers or leaders are generally the oldest and they have strong impact on others
    * Attention to detail and thoroughness
    * Manual testing dominance over test automation
    * Integration with the international community is a bit blocked by language barrier
    * Risk aversion ‚Äì a preference for proven methods rather than experimentation with new tools or practices.
    * Slow adoption of automation and agile ‚Äì change takes time due to strong reliance on established processes.
    * High customer focus ‚Äì quality is seen as protecting the company‚Äôs reputation; defects are taken very seriously.
    * Communication might be slow since people do not say "no". they prefer to keep quiet or just disappear, so the other side may be waiting for nothing.  

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- No observations
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- In Japan, I was surprised to see how people advocating test planning and test design. Nowadays, everyone just tries
  to finish the minimum set and have an opinion about ready-to-go decision as soon as possible. Here, I saw people not
  too much caring about automation, but making test plans and test scenarios.

What are the biggests strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Turkey  
  * Strength: Turkish people are highly dedicated and hardworking, with solid technical skills.
  * Weakness: The same flexibility that enables quick wins can sometimes lead to skipping proper procedures, creating the risk of disorganized or inconsistent outcomes.
- Japan
  * Strength: Extreme attention to detail and process discipline, resulting in very high-quality, reliable software.
  * Weakness: Rigid hierarchy and strict adherence to procedures can slow innovation and make adoption of automation or agile practices slower.
