## üá≥üá± Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
The Netherlands has a lot of software testing pioneers. TMAP was born here and also ISTQB foundation was co-written by Dutch testers. 
The Dutch like to show their successes on international stages and are very open and direct about talking.

In addition,
- The Dutch have a lot of fragmentation in terms of tooling/process
- There is very little standardization and strategy
- Trendhopping when it comes to tools/frameworks is common
- True CI/CD is found mostly in E-commerce and Fintech
- There are huge education providers in testing.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
I've lived in Poland and South-Africa but not as a tester. So wouldn't be able to answer this.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in terms of testing?:
The amount of test legends coming from such a small country as the Netherlands. Also the amount of Dutch speakers on conferences.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- The Netherlands
* Strength: Direct communication, innovative
* Weakness: Too much talking and difficulty cutting cords as well as too much regulation
