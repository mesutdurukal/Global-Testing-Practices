## üáØüáµ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Russia: Many "product" companies have long since employed crossfunctional teams approach, where testers are on the same team with developers. However, testers are still blamed for bugs and bad quality quite often. In many cases, testers are pushed to overwork, however, overtime is often paid for. There's also a strong belief in the industry that testing is the easiest way to start a career in IT, and there's an abundance of online courses exploiting this belief with average or bad educational content and false promises of fast employment. Testers are also often laid off amongst the first people when the economical situation in the company gets worse. However, as Russian labour law protects the employees' rigths quite well, oftentimes laid off folks are paid out 1-2 months' worth of severance.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- I couldn't spot differences in testing technicalities between Russia and the UK. However, culturally the attitude to testers might seem much harsher in Russia than in the UK or France.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- Not really

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Russia:
  * Strength: There's a great number of extremely well-educated people in QA and Testing, some with decades of experience and math, CS or physics degrees.
  * Weakness: Since russian IT has been growing steadily during the last 20 years, and as I've said above, there's an abundance of bad courses and interest in getting into IT through testing, there's a huge number of poorly educated testers.
