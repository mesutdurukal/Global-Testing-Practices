## 🇦🇺 Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  - India: I started my career in India in 2000 and testing was already an established service line in most of the IT services organisations like Wipro, TCS, Infosys. It was a mix of manual (functional) and automation testing. In India testing was both manual and automation.
  - UK: During 2008/9 there was a shift towards Agile testing and SDETs. The UK has a mix of home grown talent and those migrating.
  - Australia: In Australia now in 2025, I am seeing a mix of manual, automation and GenAI infused testing. Same with Australia, there is a mix of home grown talent and those migrating.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  - In modern world everyone tests blurring the boundaries – be it testers, developers, Business Analysts.
  - In spite of robust testing, strong coverage, automated DevOps pipelines, and sign offs, failures still show up in production.
  - While automation testing has focus on repetitive tasks, exploratory testing is still meaningful.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  - The persistence of production failures even with robust testing, strong coverage, automated DevOps pipelines, and formal sign offs.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
  - India:
    * Strength: India has the scale of talent.
  - UK:
    * Strength: UK has mix of home grown talent and those migrating.
  - Australia:
    * Strength: Same with Australia, there is a mix of home grown talent and those migrating.

What is your view on AI and testing?:
  - AI is not going to replace testers, it is going to complement. AI also needs to be tested.
