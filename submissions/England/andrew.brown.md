What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  "I first started working in software development as a result of a fortuitous event. We were in the Y2K and the .com boom, and a neighbour required extra resources. He took me on and I became an SAP ABAP programmer. Although I worked on some fairly large projects (most SAP projects are large, often enterprisewide) there were not any dedicated testers or testing team. This seemed to be fairly normal at this time.

I started working in testing as a result of an unplanned event. The .com boom had turned into the .com nuclear winter, I had been made redundant, and I was looking for a job. There was a vacancy for a test manager at a small software consultancy making software for the financial sector. I altered my CV to make it look as if I had some testing/test management experience, and I got the job. Our testing was mainly manual, focused upon the UI, and was typically very active. Again, this seemed to be typical for the industry at the time.

I left and took a job as head of testing at HMV. Training and certification was becoming more prevalent, so I managed the team through the ISTQB foundation certification. Testing was mainly manual, with some automation, although in all honesty I don't think that the automation saved any time/resources.

I then worked for a software testing consultancy, mainly in test automation. Primarily, I built automation scripts to test the UI of client applications. I worked for this organisation for proximally 12 years. My lasting impression is that whilst specialist technical consultancies can bring capabilities to their clients, unless the client manages the relationship appropriately, most of the benefits will accrue to the consultancy."

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  "I have worked on test projects in the Netherlands and Switzerland, via the specialist testing consultancy I was employed by.

I did not notice any marked differences in the testing approach between the countries."
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  I'm surprised that the lack of progress in the software testing industry. We are doing things pretty much the same as we were doing them 20 years ago. In contrast, if you looked at developers, you would see that they are doing things very differently.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
  I feel that the biggest weaknesses of testing in our country (England), as well as most other countries that I hear from anecdotal evidence on speaking to people at software testing conferences, is the overwhelmingly short term, parochial view of individuals involved in software development.
