## 🇩🇪 Your Observations
Feel free to write in free-text format, but you can also follow the questions below. (don't feel limited to only these)

```yaml

I haven't worked as a quality engineering professional in India, and therefore my observations are limited to Germany. 

What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Testing is seen as important in principle, but neglected in practice. When budget needs to be cut, QA budget is the first to go.
- German work culture is methodical and rule based. There is an emphasis on explicit processes and documentation.
- I've seen several test managers have a tendency to create long documents ('test concepts') that are divorced from relevance and reality on the ground. 
- There is generally a resistance to change. Most resistant are unfortunately experienced German quality professionals, followed by managers and product owners. I have found developers to be actually more open than these groups to changing and upgrading testing practices. 
- Testing practices in most companies are outdated, mainly owing to resistance to change. 
- There is an over-reliance on certifications like the ISTQB as opposed to practice real-life experience.  
- There is a massive emphasis on 'clear division of labour and responsibilities', which often hinder whole-team ownership of quality. 

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- I am surprised that in several small and medium sized IT teams, most testing is still done manually in a sub-optimal manner.
- I am surprised by the contrast between quality standards in manufacturing and IT. While Germans will insist on the highest quality standards with manufactured products, they are surprisingly tolerant of sub-standard software products. 

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- Strength: 
    - Germans are conscientious. They are sincere people, who want do deliver quality work. This intention is strongly felt. 
    - Germans are open-minded. If your colleagues buy into your mission, they can turn from opponents to your strongest allies overnight. 
    - Germans are direct and are open with criticism, speaking their minds. 
    - A strong emphasis on work-life balance, overtime work being the exception, rather than the rule. 
- Weakness: 
    - Change resistance: It takes time and persistent effort to translate intention to action. 
    - Perfectionism: There is a resistance to wait for the perfect alternative, rather than starting with a good-enough alternative and adapting as necessary.
