## üá©üá™ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  I have worked in the Testing field my country of origin, even though it was 20 years ago and then I tried an entrepreneurial experience until 9 years, when I
  moved to Germany. Those experiences in Italy shared common traits with many employee jobs in the country. Lack of flexibility, rigid hierarchy,
  expectations to work also over time or on Saturday whenever requested to. Testing processes were very formal, innovation in terms of those processes and
  test automation not trusted much.

  For Germany, I can't probably talk about a representative sample, because the company I'm currently employed at is very distant from the classic corporate
  German enterprise. We have a very international environment, literally composed by people from a large amount of nationalities, and constant
  innovation, cutting-edge technologies with freedom to try things, flat hierarchy, flexible working times with good work-life balance.

  Please take this as something I can't 100% confirm. from indirect exposure to German working culture, the characteristics are very different. the average
  German company, or at least the large traditional ones, only trusts strict rules and proven tech, is very hierarchical both in terms of management chain
  and importance of academic titles (a PhD has a huge weight) and has a very direct style of communication between workers, with probably also a more
  competitive ambience.

  Where I work, as said things are different and the leadership style encourages us to take responsibility, we proceed taking risks without fear. For example
  I could mention that over the years we changed our release processes very quickly, iterating through faster and more automated approaches, leaving
  behind a more conservative approach.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  In the companies I worked for in Italy, an extreme importance was given to test planning and there was, for different reasons, an extreme pressure to
  complete testing within tight time schedules, even though (or because) the development phase was constantly late. The not very collaborative environment
  also meant that testers were not too eager to share with peers too much about their own work, nor the management was encouraging it.

  In contrast, at my current employer there is constant exchange of knowledge and strong team spirit and support. The excellent record of our QA department
  also makes our contribution respected and our voice always heard.

  In terms of specific practices, test automation has a strong focus especially for regression testing and has evolved a lot in the last years, while testing
  of new features is less formal than what I was used to, with high trust in exploratory testing by our experienced QA engineers.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  I was mostly surprised by not being surprised too much, in the last years. I attend conferences every year, try to keep myself informed online by reading
  articles, and I've of course found a lot of inspiring content that sometimes also kickstarted some initiative by my colleagues or me, but overall I would
  say that the most popular testing approaches and even the most reliable and used tools are not changing at a fast pace. Many people already found many
  good solutions to many problems.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
  Italy:
    - Strength: Due to the demanding employers, the average Italian tech worker is actually used to hard work and a competitive environment.
    - Weakness: The English language skills and purely technical knowledge of the average Italian tester seemed to me limited, based on limited sample.

  Germany:
    - I believe even more than before, I can't answer for the country on this one.
