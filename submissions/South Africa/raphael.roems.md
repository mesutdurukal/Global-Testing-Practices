## üáøüá¶ Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
The software testing culture in South Africa has the following characteristics based on my experience,

- Corporates where software development is not a core revenue generator are risk adverse,  slower adoption of tools and processes, slower release cycle, test automation is used less.
There are dedicated software testers in all development squads, sometimes multiple, where manual testing skills are valued. Reporting is an important aspect, coverage/bugs found.
- Technology companies where software development is a core revenue generator tend are quick to adopt the latest tools and processes, tend to less risk adverse, fail fast and fix mentality. Less of a focus on dedicated software testers, more a development team approach.  Software testers here tend to  be much more technically savvy. Test automation is used more heavily, and in many cases relied upon extensively.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- No observations
    
Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  Strict release cycles, approvals needed from multiple stakeholders in corporates, punitive root cause analysis for live bugs. The purist in me can see the value in this, but when functionality is released more frequently in technology companies, sometimes multiple times a day, this can be frustrating.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
Communication is a big strength, on issues detected and giving feedback on progress. 
A weakness if I had to list one is that software testers not advocating enough to stop a release, when something is fundamentally wrong, when there are pressures to meet a deadline.
