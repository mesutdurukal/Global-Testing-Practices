## 🇹🇭 Your Observations
Feel free to write in free-text format, but you can also follow the questions below. (don't feel limited to only these)

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- For a specific company in Thailand, the process, practice and convention are quite mature from the clear direction from the management level.
- For a specific company from Japan, the testing culture is not mature. No direction from a person in high level position. Without leader, each team would do whatever they think is right.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- In a specific Thai company, the the automation pipeline are integrated since I joined the team. It also come with the test result portal to store the test result for historical tracking.
  It's often used for Daily health check and regression test before the release. So, the deployment is safer and reliable. QA would dedicate with manual testing along with Automate ones and also work closely with developers to improve the quality of the product.
- In a specific Japanese company, it always rely on manual testing. The test automation are just a nice-to-have tool. The adoption rate is really low even the quality pipeline are completed. The test result are not stored for historical tracking.
  Only a team is consider to use to automate test for regression test before the release. The deployment is risky and not reliable. But the QA direction are not given to the team. So, each team would do whatever they think is right.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
- In a specific Japanese company, it try to apply Automation to the life cycle. But not promote not participate in the process. Result in really low adoption rate.
  Then, the direction shifted to saving cost. So it got a high chance that all automation would be abandoned and go back to manual testing only.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- A specific company in Thailand 
  * Strength: Limited Freedom to express ideas and opinions within the mature QA process. Clear direction and Evaluation.
  * Weakness: Medium competitive environment. Higher skill set is required to keep up with the process and practice.
- A specific company from Japan
  * Strength: Freedom of choice to try out new things. Low competitive environment due to no clear direction and evaluation. 
  * Weakness: Those new things are not evaluated and not given a clear direction from the management level. So QA improvement is locked in stagnation.
