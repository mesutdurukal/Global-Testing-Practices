## üáÆüá≥ Your Observations

What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  Traditionally, QA in India has been very process-oriented. They follow rigid test-case documentations, step-by-step executions,
  and sign-offs. They always have a cost-efficiency mindset. The mindset influenced how teams were structured, like large manual 
  testing pools, offshore delivery models, and labor-intensive processes. With digital transformation, the focus is shifting from 
  being low-cost testers to becoming value-add quality engineers. We also add strong manual testing backbone. This comes from 
  universities and training institutes producing testers who start careers by executing scripts, running regressions, and logging defects.
  The Indian testers are community and certification-oriented, which play a high value on ISTQB certifications, QA meetups, and
  community-driven learning. It is now getting shifted towards GitHub portfolios, open-source contributions, and hackathon experiences. 
  QA has historically been seen as second to development. Testers often lack decision-making power, and their role is reduced to bug finders. 
  One of the biggest trends of Indian QA community is its adaptability. Whether it was Y2K, the era of ERPs, mobile testing, and now AI-driven, 
  the Indian testers have consistently upscaled to remain relevant. Many testers are moving into hybrid roles like SDET. 
  Indian testing culture is a blend of discipline, cost-consciousness, and adaptability. Legacy outsourcing models emphasize volume and documentation. 
  The new wave is focused on agility, automation, and value-driven QA.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  Testing in India has been shaped heavily by its outsourcing legacy, where large global enterprises relied on Indian QA teams 
  for cost-efficient, process-driven work. This created a culture where **manual testing, detailed documentation, and strict 
  compliance** were the norm. Certifications like ISTQB became a common entry point, and testers often specialized deeply in 
  **domain expertise**‚Äîbanking, insurance, telecom‚Äîmaking them not just bug finders but also functional consultants. Compared to 
  the West, where QA roles have increasingly shifted toward engineering-heavy profiles like SDETs, Indian testing has historically 
  leaned more toward **scale and functional knowledge** than pure technical depth. 
  That said, the culture is evolving rapidly. Modern Indian product firms and startups are embracing **agile, automation, and 
  shift-left practices**, with testers taking on hybrid roles across automation, DevOps, and even AI-driven testing. The QA mindset 
  is moving from being purely **cost-focused** to being **value-driven**, emphasizing customer experience and business outcomes. 
  While Western teams often experiment with bleeding-edge tools first, Indian teams are known for their **adaptability**‚Äîquickly 
  upskilling and scaling new practices once they prove ROI. The result is a unique QA culture, **structured, resilient, and domain-rich**, 
  yet agile enough to reinvent itself in step with global trends.
