## üá≥üá± Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
- Dutch professionals strongly value their work-life balance. They are willing to put in extra effort for special occasions, but regular overtime is not part of the culture.
- Companies in the Netherlands often operate with flat organizational structures. This encourages open collaboration and equal dialogue between development teams, QA, and management.
- Direct communication is a key cultural trait. Feedback, including on quality issues, is usually clear, honest, and straightforward, which helps resolve problems quickly.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
- Many Dutch QA professionals are certified in TMAP instead of ISTQB, which is another methodology and certification program for software testing.
- There is a strong open source mindset. Many Dutch organizations adopt or contribute to open source tools and frameworks. Dutch government repositories are mandated to be open source, which promotes transparency, knowledge-sharing, and trust.

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in terms of testing?:
- No observations

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country?:
- The Netherlands
  * Strength: Dutch directness can be a big strength. Being straightforward and calling things out directly creates transparency, faster problem-solving, and more honest discussions about product quality.
  * Weakness: The same directness can sometimes be perceived as rude or too harsh by colleagues from cultures that value a more indirect or diplomatic communication style.
