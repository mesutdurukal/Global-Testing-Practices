## 🇷🇴 Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
  First I started working in a big test team (waterfall), then is smaller scrum teams. QAs were seen as “quality keepers”. 
  Later, when I started working for another company and being in touch with colleagues from Germany, QA engineers/ testers were seen as “clickers”. 
  People who did not fit anywhere, were put to do testing work. This led to test specialists having less respect.  
  Currently, situation is much better and colleagues understand the value testing brings and why it is necessary.

How is testing practiced differently in your country?:
  Testers in my country usually have an engineering diploma, or graduated computer science, versus in other countries (the Netherlands for example they typically don’t).

Is there anything you were surprised to see anywhere in term of testing?:
  I was surprised to see that in Germany they are more rigid to change or thinking freely. They rely a lot on checking specifications vs proactively suggesting a chance. 
  I was surprised how for Ukrainians hierarchy is very important.

What are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your country (please add all where you have lived/experienced)?:
  Strengths: technical skills. Flexible in adopting new way of working, tools or processes.
  Weaknesses: Miss on opportunities to make their work visible. Sometimes they have a hard time to transfer their thoughts in tasks that other people can understand.
