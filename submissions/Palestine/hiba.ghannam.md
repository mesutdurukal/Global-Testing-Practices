## 🇵🇸 Your Observations

```yaml
What is the characteristic of your country in terms of testing culture?:
    * In Palestine: Emphasized delivery and quality where applicable, adapting to different startup environments and leadership approaches
    * In some international startups the process was simple but effective, while in others, lack of structure created communication challenges and a focus solely on speed of delivery.
    * Integration between Palestinians and the international communities is sometimes constrained by geography, local tech      community size, and the political situation. 
    * Faced challenges in applying best practices during rapid growth phases.
    * In Palestine: Junior-heavy teams sometimes limited mentorship and slowed the accumulation of practical experience.
    * Observed a strong reliance on manual testing over automation in most startup environments.
    * Slow adoption of test automation, often due to limited budgets, small team sizes, and the fast-paced delivery focus of growing startups.
    * Some international clients require Palestinian outsourcing teams to implement automation testing, ensuring compliance with client standards and quality expectations.
    * US-based managers prioritize both automation and manual testing, even in startup environments, emphasizing balanced and effective QA practices.
